Everything seems to indicate that the crucial dimension is that between instrumental and substantive rationality.
- the personal integrity of anarchism vs the instrumentalism of marxism
- ethos and elan vs a separate realm of strategy (that is, even activists notion of “goal, strategy, tactics” begs the key questions of how to live and therefore simply skips precisely to the battlefield in which it has already been crushed)

This also explains why today all currently existing social movements are completely unable to build anything which can even pretend to challenge the dominant institutions. Because the public sphere has been so completely subordinated to instrumentalism—the only speech which is even sensible is that which meets some minimal threshold of self-interest, because nothing else is credible—the most preliminary efforts to establish a genuinely kind and loving contact with another human being are basically impossible—let alone build radical ties or a social movement!
This extraordinary change, and undeniable *decay* in communications has never before been fully identified, let alone explained.
Instrumental communication is a means to some end which is not communicated in the message. That which seeks to make the receiver do something at the cost of some transparency (treats them as a means to an end; the first goal is to achieve something for the speaker’s interests).

non-instrumental communication is an end in itself which the communicator says for no reason other than whatever satisfactions are brought by saying it. Or importantly, if there is a larger end to speaking it, this is included in the message. Non-instrumental communication therefore treats the receiver as an end in themself, because the only instrumental 
value the communication can bring is through the autonomous action of the receiver after learning transparently the contents of the message.
They are perhaps never fully one or the other, but the argument here does not require absolute purity. It is enough to mark out objectively the consistent markers of the one and other.
There has always been a conflict between instrumental communication and non-instrumental (let’s call it sincere) communication. Typically, historically, instrumental communication is the communication of the relatively powerful and sincere communication is the communication of the powerless; additionally, instrumental communication is the communication of the powerful as well as the powerless in spaces and times relatively characterized by power struggle (in a job interview, for instance, where someone is obviously and consciously involved in a competition to win the means to sustain one’s life), whereas sincere communication is the communication of all people in spaces and times relatively insulated from power struggles (with loved ones, for instance).
While these types of communication have always co-existed, for most of human history they have been in equilibrium. Before the printing press, ruling elites in any particular society did not have an advantage in exercising instrumental communication over their subjects. They had symbolic machinery no doubt, but the subjects had what since time immemorial has been the most powerful communicative structure: being socially embeded among others in a concretely shared, if rarely equal, co-production of life. Indeed, to this day, it is known very well that one’s attitudes and behaviors are most crucially shaped by one’s “primary group,” precisely the individuals by whom one is surrounded on a day-to-day basis.
Thus, the instrumental communications of the powerful have always been held in check by structures within which sincere communication prevailed. The lies of kings might have been obeyed because the balance of power forced subjects to accept them, but the history of human society shows amply that wherever domination prevails there also prevails the wisdom of the relatively weak who, sometimes laughing and sometimes crying and sometimes in silent gestures, always ultimately are the only bulwark which refutes the self-interested communications of the dominant.

However, since the industrial revolution, profound changes have occurred in this communicative balance of power.

In periods where the ability for a particular source to reach many people increases, there is always a sudden appearance of revolutionary political communication and revolutionary political upheaval. But after this opening, that which was so powerful for the forces of sincerity is exploited for instrumental purposes. While anyone can pursue their instrumental purposes after a sudden increase in the ability to reach people, almost by definition the most powerful will be able to spread their instrumental communications more widely than the less powerful.

(always quicker to the punch precisely because that which is sincere and organic is always waiting to explode, whereas that which strategically manipulates can only respond, hence we call this “reactionary”.)

I propose a thesis regarding how this has been caused in history. There has always been a conflict between the instrumental communication which and non-instrumental communication. **Whenever the ability for one location to contact multiple other locations increases, this empowers both sincere and instrumental communications in the short-run. But in the long-run, instrumentalism extends its reach more than sincerity.**
There is one main problem. In short, the ability to use this communication is conditioned by the distribution of power, so that only those with the resources to use the technology can use it for either sincere or instrumental communications. Some fraction will use it for sincere and another will use it for instrumental, but the degree to which it used for either will be determined largely by how much those with power to use it are invested in the status quo institutions. If the fraction of people to use communication technology benefit from the status quo, even sincere use of it will only be liberating for that fraction of the people, as they will be intersted in communicative liberation but not at the cost of their privileges. This is the example of liberals in the Dewey camp during WW1. In a more already-equal society, increases in communication

## How Instrumental Rationality Favors the Right and Inhibits the Left
The problem of most left political thought and practice since time immemorial is that, because they are generated precisely by exploitative institutional arrangements, the only left messages which receive recognition within such cultures are those which respond to the material needs of the exploited. This is perfectly understandable, because the material needs which sustain life are both ethically and practically prior to any possible social movement on other grounds. This is why normatively lofty or aesthetically-driven currents of leftist political thought and practice are always mocked in every period: when some people are starving, rhetorical flights of any sort do *seem* to reflect mistaken priorities. Thus it is that mature and decent leftists always tend to discipline the younger more “idealistic” leftists into calming their normative and rhetorical passions in favor of the hard work of getting material gains for the most exploited people.
While this is perfectly understandable and quite natural to sympathize with, there is an extraordinary problem with this tendency. Specifically, it grants to the exploitative institutional arrangements their most crucial ethical and epistemological assumption: instrumental rationality. It is necessary for the exploited to practice the instrumental rationality required for survival, but the problem is that because of this need, the left capitulates *in general* to instrumental rationality as the proper analytical orientation to social and political struggle. Anything which opposes instrumental rationality is, to the committed and *rational* leftist, a prodigal self-indulgence of an immature and “privileged” soul uneducated in the history of the Practical Left.

Nevermind that the history of the Practical Left is a history of betrayal, capitulation, and ultimately, complete failure—given that domination and exploitation not only continue to exist but in the institutions of global capitalism institutionalized more powerfully than ever before in the history of humanity.

# Economic power to computational rather than ethical thinking
A huge problem with the information age is that because computational skills are rewarded disproportionately, and the top calculator minds quickly become privileged by the status quo, what comes to be counted and calculated tends to be motivated by a blithe confidence and satisfaction with the institutions of the status quo.

# principled contentious action
We might call “principled contentious action” anti-institutional or anti-systemic political behaviors grounded in truth claims
this is what has been pacified
there are still some contentious uprisings
and there are still people making truth claims
but these have been separated, and that is the crucial mystification which defines our world.
but zola was also very strategic, how is that different than today?
being strategic in a principled campaign is different than today, which is generating principles to serve strategic ends. in the former, ends are sincere but the means are strategic. in the latter, means are sincere but the ends are dishonest. zola took radical strategic action in pursuit of forcing truth and justice, even if he did it strategically; non-profit organizations use claims of truth and justice as a vehicle for strategically promoting certain groups.

# Understanding the nature of commercial bias
mass media have not programmed people to think or act in a certain way, they simply disconnect popular *resistance* from the reality of political affairs

the mechanism through which they do this is simply giving people what they want to hear and see. this is acknowledged by every media scholar to be a fundamental fact of commercial media. but it’s effect is to create “noise” in the democratic mechanism whereby people positively or negatively to political affairs. Because by definition people are receiving what they want, the bias is not left or right but rather media are biased in favor of system-level dynamics and against within-system dynamics. This is how we can account for the perplexity that people often think the media is TOO critical of politicians AND that it is not critical enough.

but it’s not just noise in the sense of random noise, it is by definition reinforcing of what they already think and feel and believe. this sounds like it might push radicals to be more radical and conservatives to be more conservative but this is wrong. why? because of a fundamental assymetry between left and right, which spatial models of politics fail to account for.

summarize the spatial model. that’s useful but quite poor in a key respect.

the right is whatever political reality is. the left is the desire to change the status quo to bring it more in line with justice. the right is that the status quo is justice and the change they promote is to stop those efforts.

thus, commercial media is inherently conservative. it has the effect of reinforcing the status quo (the right) by giving people what they already want, rather than connecting them to whatever might be wrong with the world, thus pacifying the crucial inputs which historically lead people into contention with dominant powers.

what exactly has been pacified? principled contentious action. there’s still contention because there’s plenty of ways to be contentious roughly in support of the status quo.
what has been foreclosed is resistance to the status quo based on ethical or spiritual commitments. instrumental contentious action persists, because instrumental contentious action is the dominant mode of life sanctioned and encouraged by the status quo.

principled contentious action is not left or right. like marxists didn’t support dreyfus, and some bourgeois political moderates did. if there is anyone who embodies it, it’s the radical public intellectual of theory and action.
