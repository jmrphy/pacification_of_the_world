\begin{abstract}

These are extremely rough lecture notes which I'm compiling as a very first effort to outline the contours of some questions, hunches, and hypotheses I (or you) might like to demonstrate moving forward. As such,
there are likely to be extraordinary gaps, understatements and overstatements, unclear prose and unclear logic,
missing references, and all kinds of inadequacies which no decent and respectable academic would ever publicly air. Thus, I do not air them here in my capacity as an academic, but merely as a thinking person who weekly must speak on certain questions about politics under unfortunate time and bureaucratic constraints. That which can be known is perhaps the safest material to teach, but it is politically biased because the data-generating process of data itself is not random. Thus, I try to teach what I honestly think about what is known, which strikes me as both an ethical and scientific imperative. That's my only justification for releasing this woeful hodgepodge of notes. Also, cuz the internet and ftw.
