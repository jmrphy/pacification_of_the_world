The overall issue is that mass media representations are shaped in a systematically conservative way--not that they necessarily report on conservative political parties more favorably than leftist parties, although this is how media bias is often conceived. 

Rather, the point is that in a capitalist society, media representations will have a conservative bias with respect to the dominant institutions, for example, those institutions which are the common ground of political parties as such. So the issue is not that the media are more or less favorable to left parties or right parties; the issue is that they will not question the legitimacy of political parties *as such*.

So in any patriarchal, white-dominated, capitalist society, the mass media will be sexist, racist, and biased against the critique or protest against capitalism simply because its bias is that it reinforce the hard-wired biases of society (institutions).

When right-wing movements emerge, it's "I might not agree but they are really doing something."

"Neutrality" is a conservative bias because the "center" is defined by power; as such, it will always be a bit further to the right than the actual centre-point between the interests of all people.

When right-wing phenomena emerge, they might be treated with skepticism but they are acknowledged as existing and their power is affirmed. When left-wing phenomena emerge, it's childish, idealistic, cunning, manipulative, and ineffective. Comparison of Kingsley Read and the Anti Nazi League is exemplary.

But in doing so, it *makes* the left-wing movement ineffective. And then nothing at all about the local grassroots types of organizing that people of color do by themselves, which are not even newsworthy.

Thus, media simply replicates and thereby reinforces the inherent asymmetry between the forces of right and left. Because it's always easier to defend that which institutions are aligned on the basis of, and inherently more difficult to argue against that which institutions are invested in, the media simply reflects this and amplifies this.

So it represents the world in a fundamentally conservative way even when it's balanced and neutral.

Talks about BBC's principle of neutrality

- When the British National Party emerges, it's "remarkable" even if dubious

- When the Black Panthers emerged, it's either not covered or completely demonized

- David Duke, leader of the KKK, wanted by the Home Office and Police as an illegal entrant, given a platform on BBC

- Is Fidel Castro allowed to give a TV speech to the British people?

- In the 1980s there was a lot of blatantly racist media, television and movies etc.

- BBC as respectable and genteel, Lord Reith says what's wrong with that?

Racist tropes
	- "They" work too hard
	- But also "they" are lazy and live off the dole
	- "They" don't understand organizing/activism

	Very interesting when someone criticizes a television producer directly. The producer responds by saying that this kind of multi-cultural environment makes members from all the different races more comfortable with each other. That it's just for enjoyment.

	But as Stuart Hall points out, this entertainment and enjoyment functions to make real inequalities more tolerable. That is perhaps exactly what the producer is saying, but in a more concealed way: that racist comedy takes a nasty and violent reality and makes it enjoyable. That's why this kind of "multi-cultural" enjoyment is racist. It practically strengthens our social tolerance of racism.

	Hall analyzes a BBC report on John Kingsley Read, where he is given a platform to articulate racist attacks on foreign-born folks. The reporter says at the end that Read's accusations were not supported by the evidence, but Hall points out that this formal "neutrality" and balance hides the effect of impressions. Kingsley Read making those accusations has more of an impression than some reporter saying there's no evidence for them.

	To this we might add what is known about partisan information processing. A lot of evidence suggests that a racist-leaning person would be embolded by the racist information, and would simply reject the critique of that racist information. In fact, some studies suggest that the insinutation that Kingsley Read was wrong would make them more racist, as they would find that evidence that he's being silenced.

	The use of numbers makes people from non-white races seem as a problem, or else why would we be counting them?

# bell hooks on Madonna

- Started out feminist, but then becomes re-attached to sexism
- bell hooks argues that it's basically because capitalism requires that you sell yourself
- so she sold the revolutionary feminist until it ran out, then gave into petty stereotypes
- and also sold out black people, calling them the most sexist when she's being abused by a white man
- hooks argues that it's because there's more money to be made on the right than left
- the idea that money is the only value leads women to collude with patriarchy and people of color to collude with racism

# London Riots Coverage

	1. Duggan's murder is described as if nothing is known, all awaiting police statements
	2. Riots are described as if they were a natural disaster, and then half way through causes are considered
	3. Mostly people who condemn the protest, the protest is seen as the problem
	4. The actual problem is never even addressed; when it is, it's silenced.
