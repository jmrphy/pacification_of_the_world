1. Someday we will look back on the notion of markets as we today look back on the witch trials: as a mass-delusional catastrophe in the ethical history of the world.

2. It is not that markets don’t exist, it is not even that markets don’t work. The problem is precisely that they do work.

3. The problem with Keynseianism is that by arguing that markets don’t always work, it maintained the assumption of instrumentalism.

4. Keynes severely interrupted the revolutionary tendency, not because he was wrong, but because he was right.

5. The left in general has killed itself from moralism. It prefers to feel ethically and morally righteous over getting things right.

6. Getting it “right” requires us to admit that conservatism is “right,” it is not *false*.

7. To be radical is to choose to get it wrong with respect to the status quo, because one sees the status quo as wrong.

8. But today we have a left the DNA of which is true within the status quo.

9. It has been forced to seek truth within the status quo because mass media significantly increased the gains to being true within the status quo relative to saying the status quo is wrong. Globalization has multiplied this effect for the same reason. And since the late 1960s there's been a remarkable though essentially invisible ethical re-orientation toward consistency with exploitation.
