Many governments today use a rhetoric of "citizen engagement," and appear to be experimenting with institutional innovations supposed to enhance citizens' participation in the policymaking process (Delli Carpini 2004).

Everyone agrees "public deliberation" is essential to democracy. But what exactly are these contemporary gestures opening state politics to the public, these gestures of "participtory" expermentalism or "citizen engagement", when the history of the past several decades in most countries around the world has been a history of mass exclusion on all of the most important issues pertaining to the actual distributions of economic and political power? After decades of prioritizing business interests over the interests of poor and working people, what is really happening when a government starts claiming to open it doors? Is there any democratic value whatsoever in the gesture of welcoming the public into a castle already so captured by the wealthy?

I would argue that most contemporary gestures toward enhancing public participation in policymaking have zero democratic value. Rather, they actually *testify* to the fact that the wealthy liberal states are merely a rotten shell of captured institutions: that these so-called innovations are presently emerging is itself evidence of the successful pacification of mass public political power, for *the public would not be invited to participate if it were not already pacified, compliant, and completely unthreatening to the status quo.* The evidence for this claim is simply that when members of the public gather to make demands which threaten the interests state/corporate elites, they are at best ignored and at worst repressed. The Occupy movement is a wonderful example of this, because it was an overwhelmingly peaceful and legal, organic system of democratic general assemblies and it was ultimately repressed by the police forces of supposedly liberal states. After Occupy, it is impossible to take liberal capitalist governments seriously when they claim to be enhancing public input into the policymaking process. These so-called participatory innovations are false, purely theatrical contrivances because the institutional spaces they create for public input are simply designed in advance to not touch actual distributions of power. This is most obvious in the issue areas which tend to be associated with participatory innovations (simply the fact that nothing of "high" political significance is opened to the public) but also the degree to which public input is merely ignored if it is not consistent with state/corporate elites!

Consider the following two anecdotes from my experiences with the city government of Philadelphia. Obviously it is impossible to generalize from a few highly personal examples, but my own experiences with "citizen engagement" are so ludicrously unfavorable that I think they're worth sharing.

My first experience with a government seeking citizen engagement involved a public deliberation on the privatization of public schools in Philadelphia. The city goverenment contracted a consulting firm in Boston to devise a plan to solve Philadelphia's public school funding problems, a plan was devised, and then public hearings were held. Naturally, the masses of people who believe in public education (still a quite popular ) went to participate in this deliberation. There were about 10 people in suits at a long table, and a room filled with people who all, nearly unanimously, rejected the proposal of privatization and rather supported greater public funding for public schools. The proposal was passed, then and there.

The second was a proposal to criminalize sharing food in public, intended to end public food-sharing with homeless people. There was a public hearing where citizens were invited to voice their concerns. It was such a joke. Many religious groups, charities, and Occupy Philadelphia went to give input to the public hearing. There were too many people there in protest of the proposal that we couldn't even fit in the "deliberation" room. So they made us wait in the cold for a few hours. They had a line of cops preventing us from even walking into the "public" municipal building and this "public" deliberation. When we pointed out this contradiction and stood toe-to-toe with the police line, the cops got aggressive, pushed us with their bikes, and actually broke someone's finger. And ultimately the food-sharing ban was passed anyway! Although it was later struck down by a judge, hardly very satisfying evidence of democratic justice in my opinion (although there are political scientists who try to argue that elite judges can be democratically responsive to public opinion under certain conditions, quite a fine example of the lengths to which political scientists will go to save our veneer of democracy.)

So forgive me for being skeptical of public deliberations, when the two I most clearly remember were deliberations in which nearly every single citizen deliberator rejected a proposal and then it was passed lol.

Most important, however, is to put contemporary "participatory" innovations in a wider historical view, for our historical myopia today (our tendency to see anything before 1990 as a sort of pre-history of the "real world") is itself a product of certain changes we want to make sense of. I would argue that most people who are very enthusiastic about contemporary innovations in "participatory" politics are only able to feel enthusiasm because of this myopia. When you see the contemporary moment in light of the past several decades, it is not even that the current moment looks different in scale or degree: it actually looks like a qualitatively different phenomenon. In the myopic historical view, it looks like exciting progress and evidence of a democratic trend upward. In the longer view, it looks like a paltry little blip at the end of a catasrophic decline in the actual democratic power of poor and working people (my argument that these innovations are not democracy at all but merely false gestures testifying precisely to the degree of public pacification).

As Naomi Klein points out, there was not a single case of any multiparty democracy in the 1980s opting for "full-tilt free-markets," or more specifically the neoliberal triplet of domestic economic austerity, international openness, and privatization (Klein 134) which are by and large the main, globally dominant tenets of contemporary policymaking today. These are the key policy choices (and historical drifts) which most shaped the economic and political livelihoods of human beings in the post-war periodm, and they were typically outcomes of elite choices completely insulated from popular, democratic politics.

Some of the most dramatic examples of elite, anti-democratic policymaking which most crucially shaped actual economic and distributions of power include the following. These are in no particular order and are only some of the most well-known examples.

	- Volker and the Federal Reserve in the 1970s.
	- Paz in Bolivia, 1985.
	- The coup against Allende in Chile, the rule of Pinochet from 1973.
	- Videla in Argentina in 1976.
	- In the US: Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce, Lewis Powell, Trilaterial Commission, etc., in 1970s
	- The coup against Mossadegh in Iran, the rule of the Shah from 1967
	- Lumumba in Congo 1961
	- Thomas Azari? in Burkina Faso
	- Mossadegh 1967
	- The collapse of the Soviet Union and the fleecing of Russia and Eastern Europe

In these examples and no doubt many more, democratic policymaking was directly betrayed in favor of elite preferences absolutely unaccountable to the public. And they had large, durable effects on the actual economic and political resources that would be available to later generations. Taking this historical context into account, one is tempted to sketch the following graph to put the contemporary ideology of "participation" into perspective.

This is, of course, only a thesis and is not evidence of anything as much as it is merely an elaboration of the argument I've tried to make here.
