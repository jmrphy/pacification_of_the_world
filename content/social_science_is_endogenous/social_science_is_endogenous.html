<h3>Social Science is Endogenous</h3>

<p>From the 1920s until the end of World War II, the conventional wisdom
was that the role of mass media in modern society was, and ought to be,
an instrument of propaganda for the optimal functioning of the state
(@bernays1928propaganda; @lippmann1932public). With the rise of
information theory, which would become a basis for modern computing
(@Shannon:2013iy; @gleick2011information), in the post-war period there
was a flowering of social-scientific efforts to link the propaganda-role
of media to the burgeoning framework of information theory
(@wiener1965cybernetics; @Deutsch:1953ww;@Deutsch:1966ux
@McLuhan:1994tf; @Ellul:1965uf).<sup>[To</sup> say nothing of concurrent and
parallel movements in radical, continental theory. See @Horkheimer:2009te,
@adorno2001culture, @Debord:1967vn.] Today, these incipient
social-scientific theories of the media appear remarkably cynical: given
the longstanding conventional wisdom of elites that the media were mere
tools of propaganda, the emergence of legitimately scientific models of
information quite naturally led social theorists to conceptualize the
media as instruments of social control. Thus, these early efforts are
laden with surprisingly sinister vocabularies, the most recurring themes
revolving around the control, monitoring, and shaping of mass publics.</p>

<p>These early social scientists of the media, most of whom were writing
within democratic states, had surprisingly little to say about the media
having anything to do with the empowerment of the masses. This is
puzzling given that, today, scholars and schoolchildren alike are most
immediately inclined to think of the media as a watchdog over
government, the main purpose of which is to ensure popular sovereignty
through the free flow of information. Today, even those social
scientists most critical of media effects are exceptions which prove the
rule, as they typically frame their findings as raising questions about
the medias well-known function as government watchdog.</p>

<p>If the earliest and most influential social-scientific models of the
media were so cynical, then why, when and, how did contemporary social
scientists develop such a sanguine view of the media? I do not pretend
to offer any definitive answer to such questions, but we ought to
float some short and provisional answers to these questions. </p>

<p>So where did our benign democratic notions of the media come from, when
for several decades the conventional wisdom on the role of media was
expressly anti-democratic and the very nature of information was now
becoming understood scientifically? This intersection in intellectual
history would seem to predict a future in which the various media would
become all the more powerful tools for small national elites to control
and manipulate mass publics, the vision largely shared by so many
incipient post-war social scientists. But yet, the notion of propaganda
recedes from the social sciences from its high point around 1950, while
the study of information continues increasing and the social scientific
study of media begins in earnest.</p>

<p>In some sense, these social-scientific currents which are only just
beginning to theorize the mass media with an emphasis on propaganda and
information control are absorbed by government and the private sector.
It appears as if this incipient social-scientific perspective is adopted
and <em>put into practice</em> by various branches of the state, as in the rise
of “counterinsurgency” abroad and government “public relations” at home,
or otherwise the private commercial development of communications
engineering and “operations management.” As the new sciences of
information control are put into practice by the state and the private
sector, it is at this time that the curiously mild-mannered attitude
toward the media is elevated into a baseline for political science
research (Lazarsfeld 1944; Berelson 1954; Campbell et al. 1960).[<sup>2]</sup>
This baseline conventional wisdom of “limited effects” from media would
no doubt be challenged within political science, but it nonetheless has
remained dominant (Katz; Bartels 2008). That research funding
distributed by the U.S. government and the private sector played a
prominent role in the mainstreaming and institutionalization of the
Columbia and Michigan models of political science research approaches,
at the very same time that information theory is being rapidly mobilized
in actual state and corporate operations and logistics, further tempts
one to the hypothesis that perhaps the greatest achievement of state and
corporate media control was to have ensured that social scientists would
never quite succeed in understanding or demonstrating the media’s
function in social control.</p>

<p>This is why the present detour through intellectual history is not
merely an overly general literature review; rather, this somewhat
sociological review of the literature is itself suggestive empirical
evidence, however circumstantial, regarding a crucial transformation in
our thinking and practices of media politics. I have traced in the
record of the social sciences the transformation of media-as-propaganda
to media-as-transparency to outline a general gap in the literature
which this volume contributes to filling, but also to present some
provisional evidence, very close to home, of precisely how
media-as-propaganda may shape certain institutional political outcomes
in ways which have hardly been noticed. Indeed, if the media are most
importantly propaganda tools then, to the very degree they are
politically effective, we would expect them to go unnoticed by
institutional social science. Indeed, even the exceptions suggest
evidence for this rule, for the most popular intellectual inheritors of
the media-as-propaganda tradition today remain marginal to dominant
mainstream social science.[<sup>3]</sup></p>

<p>[<sup>2]:</sup> The Columbia group around Lazarsfeld, from the beginning, was
    really only interested in what was already a highly narrow and
    market-oriented type of behavioral variation. Bartels notes how they
    only turned to electoral behavior when they could not find grant
    money to study consumer behavior (Rossi 1959, 15-16, as cited in
    Bartels 2008). The point for our purposes is that these pioneering
    studies which would become baselines for the modern study of
    political behavior rose to prominence with a view of the media that
    already abstracted away from the more “sinister” media effects
    predicted by the group discussed above. Thus, by the 1954 *Voting: A
    Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign, *the Columbia
    group finds little evidence for the role of parties and media in
    presidential campaigns. The later Michigan group, whose election
    studies would become an increasingly institutionalized backbone of
    American political science research, also had a view of the media
    which is puzzlingly inane and conservative read alongside work of
    roughly the same period by someone such as Karl Deutsch. Of course,
    I do not here take issue with the validity of these early findings
    as far as they go; my point is only to flag that these foundational
    studies in American political science adopted an approach which
    generated strikingly inane findings on the political effects of
    media, especially when read alongside those who were grappling with
    the more general historical functions of media as institutions of
    social control.</p>
