### The Creation of Public Opinion

It is also around this time that the notion of "Public Opinion" gains serious currency, as in the writings of someone such as Walter Lippmann. Specifically, its emergence appears to have relied on the extraordinary success of American and British propaganda during World War I. It only became possible to speak of something called "public opinion" *after* national elites succeeded in using radio and newspapers to hammer millions of diverse hearts and minds into a mass public desire for war against Germany.

It is possible to get the impression today that only in the past few decades has the desire of the masses ever received close, systematic attention from government officials, as if only recently popular sovereignty has become scientific. But the desire of the masses has always been critical in politics, and has always been given close attention. Autocrats have always had to ensure that they not deviate too far from the desire of the masses, because that's when they get deposed. Public desire has always been important, and has always been studied by the ruling class, as a problem. There is very little evidence for the uncritical assumptions of contemporary political scientists that the study of public opinion is for the purpose of helping government officials better execute the will of the people. Here, interpretation of modern polling data using the language of political radicalism is far more consistent with the historical evidence than "common sense" language: the study of public opinion today is for the purpose of ensuring that the masses never get too angry. 

Whenever public opinion falls too low, something can always be done as a response; something to appease the masses and restore their faith in the system. The scientific study of public opinion, however, transforms the desire of the masses into the demands of the masses. And this is why it is one of the most marvelous counterrevolutionary devices ever evolved.

Beginnings:

- Ironically, it was the French Minister of Finance in the years just before the French Revolution who first pointed out the importance of *l'opinion publique*. Jacques Neckar was concerned with what we now call "investor confidence" and he advocated for the publishing of government accounts and policies.

- The Declaration of Independence: The very language of the Declaration of Independence requires that public opinion be taken into account. Our government functions expressly with "the consent of the governed."

- Abraham Lincoln Said: "What I want to get done is what the people desire to have done, and the question for me is how to find that out exactly." Lincoln, certainly a President with a less than unanimous approval rating, stated outright his belief in the public mandate. In his case, he used the notion of the will of the people to fight a war.

- Straw Polls: Newspapers often augmented their election coverage by interviewing voters as they left the polling place. These impromptu interviews were called "straw polls," and the first one recorded in the U.S. took place in 1824. By the turn of the century they were common in both local and national newspapers and magazines.

- Gallup: During the early years of the 20th century the rise of the social sciences in education and government brought sociology and statistics into the public consciousness. Market research firms were born — designed to help manufacturers make and market products of mass appeal.
Among the first of the practitioners of scientific polling, George Gallup founded the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1936. He quickly began to apply polling techniques to fields far beyond marketing. Soon after, The Roper and Crossley Poll (FORTUNE Poll) and Harris Poll were also up and running. The National Opinion Research Center was founded in 1941, the first non-commercial polling agency.

Today, the concept of "public opinion," as it is used by journalists and political scientists, tends to refer to an aggregate variable, a social average, which reflects the ebbs and flows of individuals' thoughts and attitudes toward some societal issue. Today, we are taught that "public opinion" refers to how the public answers the big social questions which a democratic populace must decide for itself in order to indicate the path politicians must follow. But the history of this concept reveals that, historically, the answer came before the question. At least in its modern founding, the answers of "public opinion" to the most important political questions of the time were quite explicitly decided by state elites *first*; newspapers and radios among other increasingly "mass" media were used to merely pose the right questions.

It is in this time that "propaganda" comes to have a bad name, when Americans and Germans realize they're both being manipulated. In people like Lippman and Bernays, we observe the high point of unapologetic, unashamed elitism arguing very frankly for elites to use propaganda, via the increasingly "mass" media, to promote their visions of how society should be organized.

To the typical university student today, the connection of these simple facts will sound almost like a conspiracy theory. But if this story sounds like a conspiracy theory, it is not because any of the preceding facts have been contrived or summarized fantastically: it is only because when elites actually organize to manipulate mass publics for their own political purposes, it indeed is something near to an actual conspiracy.[^conspiracy]

[^conspiracy]: It would be interesting to trace the history of when and how exactly "conspiracy theory" emerged as a pejorative term to dismiss certain accounts of political history. No doubt there will always exist many truly deranged and unverifiable narratives of political affairs, which are perhaps rightly derided as "conspiracy theories" and rejected. But it also cannot be denied that conspiracies or just conspiratorial tendencies do in fact emerge from time to time in political affairs! And it would seem to me that the pejorative power of the term "conspiracy theory" is itself a little piece of propaganda, as it tends to very successfully neutralize even perfectly true and well-documented narratives of elites engaged in actually sinister behavior! An enterprising student could trace the emergence of this term as a popular notion, when and how it gains its pejorative power and capacity to political neutralize truths about elites which otherwise would indict and threaten their public support.


### Walter Lippmann

Lippmann writes as if the antagonism determined by national geo-politics is more real than the lived relations of human beings. He thinks in all honesty that they were mistaken to have been acting as friends! (Public Opinion, 6).

But isn't it far more reasonable to say that indeed they were friends, despite the war, because they knew nothing of any reasons to oppose one another? And that it was only the media, which acted as a sort of informational tentacle of the state, which informed them that they should be opposed to one another? The news delivery functioned as a sort of order, and here Lippman testifies to this insofar as he literally attributes the messages of national war propaganda more reality than lived relations.

This is really quite extraordinary! He suggests that there is a real world outside and merely a picture in our heads, but it strikes me as far more reasonable to say that the world we live in with the people around us is the "world outside"" and that newspaper reports of conflicts between nation-states often *literally* only exist as pictures? It is an extremely curious question what permits him such confidence to suggest the opposite, despite the seemingly obvious play in the words here.

One can think of the fidelity of news reports as a distribution (Public Opinion, 15). We tend to think of it as a distribution from "left" to "right" on the traditional partisan political spectrum, but the more interesting distinction to me is the distribution across which a report locates true reality versus a false ideological picture. Obviously this raises very difficult questions about what is truth, but I'm very interested in conceiving news reports to exist on such a spectrum anyway. To my mind, one way to approach this would be to oppose institutional-system causes of problems (probably the truest) vs. other false blame targets which parties on the institutionalized political spectrum agree on. So perhaps we could imagine a true-false distinction orthogonal to the left-right distinction?

Today, it seems to me that we certainly all live in a variously different world in no small part to the explosion of media choice, but the political issue here is very different than what Lippman identified in the 1920s (Public Opinion, 18). It is not that the rich and poor live in different worlds in which they believe the other to be an enemy, it is that they live in different worlds in which they do not see each other as enemies. This strikes me as a remarkable fact today, and it would have to be determined how this came about. One hypothesis might be that the market's explosion of media choice and advertising's ability to create various specific identity niches solved the "class war" by simply removing any common ground required for even having any antagonism whatsoever.

What is interesting about Lippman is that he has the honesty to reject the optimism that a "free press" could somehow be a guarantor of society's larger interests. He says quite frankly that the press cannot be expected to supply the truth about the world, because they are too much determined by precisely the political forces which distort our image of the world (Public Opinion, 26).

### Bell Labs

Bell Labs had its origin in the research laboratory setup by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880 with money he was awarded by the French government for inventing the telephone. The lab was dedicated to the study of sound processing. The modern institution known as Bell Labs was founded in 1925 in the merging of Western Electric's research department and the engineering department of the American Telephone & Telegraph company (AT&T). Its original main focus was to improve the commercial operation of telephone exchange switches, but with an open-ended agenda for extending the frontiers of human knowledge around information processing in general. They also worked for the US government on commission, such as in Project Nike (1945) to develop anti-aircraft technology and the Apollo Program (1961) which would put the first humans on the moon, but they also did pure scientific research at the forefront of the mathematical sciences. Seven Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded to Bell Labs Researchers between 1937 and 2009.

The achievements within Bell Labs throughout the twentieth century were extraordinary. Perhaps the largest and most well-funded pursuit of scientific knowledge ever mobilized under one organizational umbrella--driven explicitly by the pursuit of profit and then in cooperation with the interests of state power--had a significant role in almost every technological advancement that marked the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Bell Labs was responsible for the first public demonstration of the fax machine, the first motion picture with sound, the first long-distance transmission of television images. Behind these now well-known consumer technologies, however, were the formal mathematical advancements of which these technologies were only applications. In particular, the mathematical advancements all had to do with the nature of information. Thus, it was also in the 1920s that Bell Labs pioneered the essential concepts of what is now known as "statistical process control," the mathematical foundations of measuring the stability and efficiency of processes (of an assembly line, for instance) and designed the first ever technically unbreakable cipher.

In 1947, Bell Labs researchers John Bardeen, Walter Brattain invented the transistor, arguably the most important advancement in twentieth-century electronics. William Shockley, also of Bell Labs, is the figure most directly responsible for the commercialization of the transistor. His Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, established in Mountain View, California, was the epicenter of what would later become known as Silicon Valley. Although his commercial efforts largely failed, several of Shockley's employees branched out and started more than 60 new enterprises in the same part of California. These enterprises included such names as Intel and ADM. Interestingly, Shockley was also an outspoken racist who believed in eugenics.

It was in 1948 that the Bell Labs Technical Journal published Claude Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", the founding document of what would come to be known as information theory.

Shannon's piece is so crucial because it states more exactly than ever before the essential mathematical structure of communication. As Shannon points out, the essence of communication is simply the process of transmitting information from one point to another point. But the defining problem which communication responds to is the fact that the world is composed of "noise," a variable but always-present background of criss-crossing signals through which purposeful communication has to pass. Go into a silent room and notice that if you listen closely you can always hear a soft hum coming from the world, if only the tiniest vibrations of air in your ear. That's noise, but it's relativley little noise, that's why it's easy to communicate with someone in such a silent room. If you're at a music concert and a band is playing, the noise might be so loud that you cannot communicate to anyone at all: this would mean there is so much noise that the signals you're sending never make it into the other person's ear. The reason your friend can't understand you is because your signal is scrambled by the large quantity of other signals in the background.

The formal terms for this essential structure are as follows. An information source produces a message. A transmitter operates on the message to generate a signal. A signal is sent through a channel (with some variable amount of noise). A receiver receives the message and transforms the signal back into a message. Finally, the message arrives at a destination.

![Reproduced from Shannon, Claude. 1948. "A Mathematical Theory of Information." *Bell System Technical Journal* 27 (3): 379–423. Image from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20498362/Images/Shannon_communication_system.png)

This simple model served as the basis for an extremely sophisticated mathematical development of the nature of communication. The mathematical developments supercharged the rigor and efficiency of a wide variety of real-world endeavours, unsurprisingly centered around maximizing the profits, power, and control of those who put these advancements into practice (indeed "control theory" becomes the literal name of one branch of information theory).

Following Tukey, who used the word in a 1947 Bell Labs internal memo, Shannon deployed the concept of "bit" as the basic unit of information. A bit is simply the amount of information gained when the value of a binary random value (taking the value of either 0 or 1) becomes known. So if there is a 50% chance a coin will land heads rather than tails, and after a flip it indeed lands heads, one bit of information is gleaned.

Shannon is commonly considered the father of the digital revolution because his formalization of the bit as the basic unit of information allowed for more efficient communication, quicker and less noisy than analog.

I think that digitalism is one of the key causal conditions which made possible such a rapid global concentration of economic and political power as the one which began in the 1970s. This marked increase in computational efficiency multiplied the social power of the already dominant institutions, in particular the state and the corporation. And I believe it has led elite social control to a level of stability never before seen in the history of humanity. I think this is one of the most crucial over-arching transformations which characterize the history of most countries in the world from 1970 to today. Needless to say, this remains purely at the level of conjecture and hypothesis. But I think we should see if these theses could be demonstrated.

### The Early Social Science of the Media

From the 1920s until the end of World War II, the conventional wisdom was that the role of mass
media in modern society was, and ought to be, an instrument of propaganda for the optimal
functioning of the state (@Bernays:2004vo; @lippmann1932public). At the same time, the war efforts marshalled an extraordinary amount of resources toward increasing elite knowledge of the information and communication sciences. The famous interstate contests of encrypting and deciphering secret codes are perhaps the best known example of this, but the developments in weaponry (for instance, anti-aircraft technology) as well as strategy (game theory) were first and foremost due to advances in the understanding of communication and information. Indeed, the mathematical theory of communication and information, as we will see, was essentially be the basis of the digital revolution and therefore everything we now associate with the information age (@Shannon:2013iy; @gleick2011information). Quite naturally, the post-war period saw a flowering of social-scientific efforts to link the propaganda role of media to this burgeoning framework of information theory [@wiener1965cybernetics; @Deutsch:1953ww; @Deutsch:1966ux; @McLuhan:1994tf; @Ellul:1965uf].[^radicals] If media were to be tools of propaganda, as many people nearly took for granted, then this new sophistication in the theory of information would make the propaganda function of the media amenable to equally sophisticated social theory and empirical research.
 
### Norbert Wiener

Norbert Wiener was arguably chief among the towering intellectual figures of the midcentury attempting to understand society with the new tools of information theory. Wiener named the new science "cybernetics," a term which gained some limited currency at the time but has since fallen into oblivion. Cybernetics was, essentially, an information theory of society: institutions, organizations, and even social systems more generally are machines comparable to mechanic devices. What they all have in common is that their existence is sustained by mechanisms which effectively send signals and respond to signals. The mechanism in an automobile engine which prevents it from overheating is a mechanism which responds to the signal of too much heat, just as the mechanism of elections is supposed to prevent politicians from pursuing unpopular policies. Information theory would allow us to understand political power and social control as essentially, in their most basic units, dynamics of communication.

For Wiener, then, communication and control were the same thing, and he argued passionately that humanity was on the brink of a new age where communication and control would define society: "The thought of every age is reflected in its technique... If the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries are the age of clocks, and the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries constitute the age of steam engines, the present time is the age of communication and control."

But Wiener also wrote passionately and ominously that the American state and small elite minorities posed an extraordinary threat in this new age of communication and control. Starting in World War II and continuing throughout the Cold War, the US state was aggressively bringing science under its aegis. This is well-known and well-documented, but it is especially interesting that it is also reflected in the lives and thought of many of the very towering intellectual figures who were at the forefront of the new sciences. Wiener, for instance, believed firmly in the independent scientist and avoided institutional affiliations, although he did choose to help the war effort in anti-aircraft research. "Without any doubt," he wrote, "we possess the world's most highly developed technique of combining the efforts of large numbers of scientists and large quantities of money toward the realization of a single project." [@Wiener:1989ud, 126].[^oppandeinstein]

[^radicals]: To say nothing of concurrent and parallel movements in radical, continental theory. See
@Horkheimer:2009te, @adorno2001culture, and @Debord:1967vn.

[^oppandeinstein]: Oppenheimer, a crucial figure in the American development of an atomic bomb, would later speak out against the hydrogen bomb and was aggressively maligned as a "security threat" by the US government and in the mass media. Einstein, as well, was mocked for his critical attitude toward developments in the state's relationship to science. All of this is to point out that the most towering intellectual figures of this time were beginning to converge on the belief that the institutional dynamics of science were unconscionable.


### That Social Science is Endogenous to Media

```

### The Emergence of an Institutionalized Discipline and the Ideology of Limited Effects

Between 1940 and 1960, there was an explosion of research into mass communications. But very different than figures such as Wiener, McLuhan, Luhmann, and the Frankfurt School, the new movement in media research was fundamentally different in its institutional context, its research methods, and ultimately its conclusions. Driven by corporate and government funding, quite naturally it strove toward knowledge that corporations and governments sought.^[Whether the research agendas arose in response to this elite demand, or this elite interest in media research arose in response to the new research methodologies, is unclear. Obviously both could be the case. They are both separately responses to marked advances in information processing: modern statistical research methods were forged with the theoretical and mathematical victories of the war effort just as the post-war communicational activism of the state and corporate sector were. The rise of a government- and corporate-funded institutionalized social science is merely the cooperation of two groups on the same rising tide of power relative to the more ethical classes.]

In *Personal Influence* (1955, 16-17), Katz and Lazarsfeld inaugurate the "powerful-to-limited effects" narrative of media research which would dominate subsequent political science research on the media. This narrative suggests that the unsophisticated theorists from the previous epoch imagined wrongly that the media has highly potent effects on the attitudes and behaviors of individuals, but that most sophisticated modern researchers find very little evidence of mass communications exerting many direct effects on its audiences. Rather, they suggest that the emerging consensus is that the media are one among many factors that influence individuals in their political attitudes and behaviors. They based their literature review on previous research by Klapper (1950) and Lazarsfeld (1948) but were also influenced heavily by Edward Shils (Pooley 2006).

They themselves are quite fair in acknowledging that possible longer-term, system-level effects of media changes simply require different approaches, but could quite likely represent significant media effects (18-19).

They themselves also point out that the orientation of media research is shaped by the sponsors, who by and large have very specific interests: 

> Now of all the different types of effects which have ever been speculated about or categorized, it is safe to say that these sponsors of research--whose goals underlie so much of mass media research--have selected, by and large, just one kind of effect for almost exclusive attention. We are suggesting that the overriding interest of mass media research is in the study of the effectiveness of mass media attempts to influence--usually to change--opinions and attitudes in the very short run.(18-19,24)

They don't question the possibility that the corporate- and state-centric research funding could actually create a bias in the development of knowledge, because they themselves had many ties to the state and to commerce. (CITATIONS) As Pooley (2006) demonstrates, Lasarzfeld packaged and repacked his findings very differently for the different audiences he shared them with; but the for the most part, he most frequently framed his findings as technical advice for people in commerce, government or public advocacy who wanted to persuade people with the media (Pooley 2006, 3).

"The powerful-to-limited-effects narrative in *Personal Influence*, in turn, was so widely embraced in the late 1950s for a still different set of reasons—because of the scholarly support it lent to the public intellectual defense of American popular culture, in the context of an evolving cold war liberalism (Pooley 2006, 5)."

Klapper's 1957 review of the literature provides a nice overview of the emerging "limited effects" consensus, which today remains largely the dominant perspective in modern political science research. Klapper's summary is very similar to the introduction of *Personal Influence,* and provides a good example of how "limited effects" was becoming a template for media scholars.

Interestingly, Klapper himself stresses quite strongly that the media tend to reinforce "existing conditions" (pp. 457). 

> Regardless of the condition in question—be it the level of public taste, the tendency of audience members toward or away from delinquent behavior, or their vote intention—and regardless of whether the effect in question be social or individual, the media are more likely to reinforce than to change. (pp. 457-458)

> The now classic *People's Choice* found reinforcement, or constancy of opinion, approximately ten times as common as con-version among Erie County respondents exposed to the presidential campaign of 1940, and a nine to one ratio was found in the more elaborate study of Elmira voters in 1948. (pp. 6)

#### But reinforcement is not a "limited effect", it's system-level convervatism

We come to the realization that latent even in the "limited effects" perspective is already an acknowledgement that mass communications are consistently found to exert status quo bias. This could only be considered a "limited effect" by a marketing executive hoping to convince audiences to buy a new product. What they did not seem to appreciate, and what their political scientists of the "limited effects" school also failed to appreciate, is that consistent reinforcement is actually a very significant political effect. It means that the mass media strengthen any status quo institutional arrangement and its distribution of power: if mass media campaigns to create specific changes consistently failed and rather revealed that mass media tend to reinforced pre-existing atttitudes and behaviors despite their content, the "limited effects" school seems to have rather demonstrated that the mass media have robust effects in convincing people *not to change*. It is no surprise that this implication was left at the laboratory table, and this is why a serious sociological perspective on this literature is so essential: this implication is striking to the critical researcher interested in understanding how unjust and unpopular institutitional arrangements seem so effective in extracting passive consent from the populace, but this observations is not instrumentally valuable to marketers or politicians.

Indeed, competing schools of thought working at this time who sought to highlight this implication and extend it were institutionally marginalized. Theodore Adorno of the Frankfurt School actually worked on a team with Lazarsfeld, until he left because his research agenda was inconsistent with the CBS-dominated research group. (Citation)


## Phase 2: The Pacification of the World, 1968-Present

These peculiar transformations in social science
curiously precede the period of remarkable, worldwide economic
integration which has come to be known as globalisation. Globalisation
typically refers to the period from the early 1970s to the present, when
countries around the world saw large increases in the flows of goods,
services, and capital across borders. It is widely thought by political
economists that economic integration is welfare-improving on net and in
the long-run, yet even staunch free market economists acknowledge that
economic integration raises the incomes of certain domestic groups and
lowers the incomes of other groups, at least in the short-run. For this
reason, globalisation has brought with it many notable examples of
political protest and social unrest. Yet, discontent around economic
globalisation has varied across time and space and there remains much
debate regarding the conditions under which domestic political processes
respond to economic globalisation in different ways.

Both the concept and the processes of globalization have had a dubious
impact on the popular political imagination. The ideology which this
very concept bears witness to is that globalisation is a process, a
noun, something which has descended on the system of nation-states from
the outside, causing rather than being caused by the actions of
policymakers. As such, the very concept represents a political bias
because the casting of human actions as a process, the replacement of
verbs with nouns ending in “-ation”, is a tendency higlighted by
critical discourse analysts of authority figures seeking to obscure the
reality of their power [Fowler 1979, 33-41].[^nouns] It is well documented
that politicians strategically deploy the rhetoric of globalization to
justify economic reform [@Hay:2011dh], and it has also been shown that
the rise of economic globalization weakens the tendency of voters to
hold politicians accountable for economic performance [@Hellwig:2007gn; @Hellwig:2007jr].

Thus, the economics, rhetoric, and politics of economic globalisation
since the 1970s appear at first glance quite consistent with the
economics, rhetoric, and politics of the media at that time. If the
disappearance of propaganda theories during and after the war
represented, as I argued above, not the decline of that idea but rather
its implementation, then it would stand to reason that the role of media
in promoting state interests appears to have played a role in the
popular and scholarly narrative of economic globalisation since the
1970s. Specifically, the overarching thesis of this volume–which remains
too abstract and provisional to permit rigorous direct testing, but
which the present studies begin to make tractable–is that the rise of
modern media around the world has, in different ways, helped state
elites to promote certain perceptions of international integration to
fundamentally undemocratic ends.


Since the end of the 1960s, in the short span of less than 50 years, we have observed the most rapid and geographically far-reaching *pacification* of humanity ever before witnessed in human history.
To detail what I mean, it is necessary to use different registers from different disciplines.
In terms of political attitudes, I have in mind the disppearance of *system-level opposition* in political issues (despite system-level dissatisfaction).
In terms of political behavior, I am most interested in the effective disppearance of *system-level contention*.
In sociological terms, this is noted as the increase in “anomie,” decrease of “trust,” and finally the depletion of “social capital.”
In philosophical terms, this means the global onset of “cynicism” and the failure of the last serious effort at Critical Theory.
In intellectual and emotional life more generally, this is the explosion of instrumental discourse at the cost of expressive discourse. 
This possibility of democratically, collectively controlling the institutions of our society would be crushed by the information revolution in the long-run, for the simple reason that the empowerment it generated was first enjoyed, and most effectively used, by precisely those most invested in the currently dominant institutions we might summarize as “global capitalism.” The institutional power of large state and corporate entites was so increased by the information revolution that it biased the thought and behavior of *more people*, across *larger distances*, and *more rapidly* than any scientific-technological change in the history of the world.
The reason the information revolution was so remarkable is because the science of information is the science of power. In this sense, it was not just a technological development (an increase in power) which increased the economic power of states and corporations, like the steam engine. The information revolution increased the power of power itself, by extending its efficiency and extending its reach to domains it never previously knew how to enter. This is why “globalization” and “mass media” modern finance, and the statistical sciences are all epi-phenomena of this same critical juncture of which our current lives are merely the hangover period.
The way it did this was by increasing the payoff to speaking and acting according to the rules of the current institutions, relative to the payoff of speaking and acting in system-level opposition to institutions. Because it increased the power of power, it forced those with lesser amounts of power to speak the dominant terms in order to achieve any goals whatsoever. And it paid them mightily for it. At the same time, it radically decreased the payoffs to those who preferred the longer-term goal of resisting the status quo temptations and fighting the radical fight for an even better society with fundamentally different institutions.
This is how the global radical currents of the late 1960s were so quickly transformed into speech and behavior compliant with global capitalism and its auxilliary institutions.
that the scientific understanding of information is almost completely monopolized in the hands of those who most benefit from the current arrangement of institutions. This is not to say that an elite cabal is in complete control, quite the contrary: the information revolution has directly empowered the institutions of global capitalism merely *through* the bodies and souls of those who most benefit from it. The information revolution has swept away its most privileged groups from their own power as much as it has swept away our collective political power to change the institutions. This is evidenced by the fact that almost all of the most powerful people in the world have the ethical and intellectual maturity of infants. They are literally too stupid to understand any ethical reality outside of that specific ethics which pays them. The reason the information revolution so completely changes the game is that the scientific understanding of information empowered the already ethically infantile money-seekers to not only abandon themselves in narrow self-interest, but to make the world over in their image. Specifically, it so increased the reach of exploitative capacity, and therefore so increased the profits available, that profit-seeking overtook the world in a sudden blast which we are still only trying to understand. The years from 1917 to today, but in particular the years from 1960 to today, so increased the reach of exploitation, into minds as well across global distances, that it completely changed our entire ethical perspective, but we continue to use old categories enforced by precisely those people whose profits have exploded and who have given themselves the right to change a great deal…
Information power is basically the power behind power itself: with the information revolution, the dominant institutions now protect and extend themselves through an evolutionary logic. Though if this saddens you, it is only because you’re addicted to the idea of power…

### Another way to see the puzzle is to compare globalizations

Another way to look at the puzzle is to consider how, in the first wave of globalization from 1870-1920, there was massive and militant worker resistance. This is the high time of the Second International, militant trade unionism such as the IWW, and sometimes terroristic, organized anarchism. Also great migrations and movement.
Today’s globalization is largely a globalization without people, where migration is not nearly as free as it once was (though of course there are what Saskia Sassen calls “counter-geographies” of globalization composed of often illicit population movements), and where worker resistance is not nearly what it was in the previous period most comparable in terms of global economic change. Comparing globalization today with the previous period is another way to motivate the puzzle: if the main precedent for globalization seems to entail massive popular movement of various sorts, how is it that today’s globalization has proceeded without similar popular tumult?


[^nouns]: Interestingly, it is also a tendency of social scientists (Billig
    117).

### The False Promise of Non-Profits and "Global Civil Society"

Selznick (1949) is the first definitive work on the notion of co-optation and remains a seminal reference. Cooptation is defined as "the process of absorbing new elements into the leadership or policy-determining structure of an organization as a means of averting threats to its stability or existence." Formal cooptation is "the sharing of public symbols or administrative burdens of authority and public responsibility, but without an actual transfer of power."

There is ample evidence that non-profit or "third sector" organizations, even if they begin as visionary and militant activist organiztions seeking to challenge the dominant powers and change the status quo distribution of resources in a fundamental way, are eventually co-opted by those who seek to maintain the status quo. Selznick details at length how this happened to the Tenessee Valley Authority, and even straight-laced hard-nosed public administration scholars today find this process to aptly characterize non-profit policy-making networks (O'Toole and Meier 2004).

The conventional wisdom is that the increasingly networked form of the third-sector is leading to a decentralization of power and therefore a more flexible, open, and ultimately democratic structure. But what O'Toole and Meier show in their quantitative analysis of public school districts in Texas is that non-profit organizations and their newtorks tend to be biased toward the more powerful nodes in their network. Increasing networks do not decentralize or redistribute power more publicly, it merely brings larger swaths of the public into the mainstream policy-making orbit, possibly making them identify with the mainstream policy machine and merely making them complicit and partially responsible for its outcomes, without any change that would represent the network moving correspondingly toward the interests of these newly enfranchised nodes. What they find is that as the network expands, the interests of the most powerful nodes continue to be disproportionately advanced, there is no gain in the interests of the less powerful nodes. No sharing of power, only sharing of responsibility for the policy agenda prefered by the most powerful.

So there's nothing especially controversial about the claim that non-profit and third-sector organizations are not sectors of social change contesting exploitation and domination by states and corporations so much as they are subsidiary, auxilliary organizations *for* exploitation and domination by states and corporations. This is not a fringe left-wing idea!

But in the 1970s, the process of co-optation goes global on a scale I don't think we've ever seen before. Milton Friedman wins the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, after the policies he championed were forced onto the people of Chile and Argentina (by his students) with brutal repression. One year later, Amnesty International wins the Nobel Peace Prize largely for its work on exactly these human rights abuses. The contradiction is extraordinary. (Klein 2010, 118; Letelier 1976)

It seems at this point as if the "international community," led by Washington, is developing a new type of "social pact." In the immediate post-war period, the US and the countries of Europe saw strong state investment and state-sponsored provision of public services to complement liberal markets, and the result was (relatively) broadly shared economic growth until the early 1970s. This was widely considered to be kind of grand social bargain between capital and labor, where capital would be relatively free but active, Keynesian government spending would make this an "embedded liberalism" (Ruggie 1982). I think we can seize on the extraordinary irony of the 1976-77 Nobel prizes as marking the public, international debut of a very different social pact with which Washington would seek to replace the Keynesian norm of the liberal democracies.

The bargain was that if leftists and working people around the world acknowledged that neoliberal policy agendas would go forward, then in return leftists would be honored and celebrated and pretty well funded if they limited themselves to merely cleaning up the mess. As long as the leftists didn't resist the neoliberal policy agenda, they would be given legitimation and funding to do "humanitarian" work. Of course, if they continued with questioning and resisting policy trends, they would be silenced or mocked for their naivete at best ("do you not understand economics!?"), and at worst killed, tortured, etc. In many countries, remember, leftists were literally disappeared, tortured, and killed en masse. At the same time, states around the world, led by institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank and the Nobel, increased funding of the non-profit sector and human rights organizations.

Poeple who came of age after the 1990s tend to think the "third sector" is the sector of people who want to make the world better, the sector of people who reject the pursuit of profit and want to dedicate themselves to helping people. And of course, the people drawn to this sector often are this kind of person. But what they often fail to realize is that this sector has almost nothing to do with social change and almost everything to do with permitting and even empowering the more exploitative state and corporate ventures to which its members are often very opposed. This whole sector is not about social change or making the world better, it is the dried-up carcass of social change. It is what emerged when the masses who rejected exploitation and domination and who once demanded justice and equality were tortured into submission and then offered money and legitimacy in return for keeping quiet.

Thus, it is not only that the third sector is constrained; it is that, because it has evolved out of what states and corporations would permit here and there, it has actually evolved as an auxilliary to their operations. Cleaning up the mess they leave behind to actually protect the state's and the corporation's public image.

I would argue this is one of the most important dynamics in the past several decades, for it represents a truly global co-optation on a scale and speed never before seen in the history of the world. It basically folded radical left resistance into capitalism in many (although certainly not all) countries around the world, in the space of only about 20 years (about 1970 to 1990).

1.) The third sector has actually been deployed strategically by governments to distance themselves from responsibility. As O'Toole and Meier explain:

> "An obvious instance in this regard is the response of U.S. governments to the HIV/AIDS problem in the early years of the epidemic. As has been documented in some detail (Shilts 1987), American governments—particularly the national government—were slow to accept the policy and political responsibility for the challenges of HIV/AIDS. The topic was contentious, the solutions not obvious, and the target groups marginalized. The HIV problem chal- lenged the standard approaches favored by public health bureaucracies at all levels of government and exposed the “wicked problem” aspects of the issue. As a consequence, for a number of years key political actors showed little interest in tackling the HIV direct-service challenge di- rectly. Nonetheless, activists and some public health ex- perts pressed the government for action. The upshot was a pattern of indirect government support for a network of (primarily) nonprofit, community-based organizations and related groups. The nongovernmental actors carried the work at the front lines, exposed themselves to direct local visibility and challenge, and advocated for the cause and for the partially disempowered constituencies. Meanwhile, national and most state governments were able to distance themselves from service-provision efforts and the more controversial aspects of public education. Work with gay communities and intravenous drug users was conducted at a distance, with many governments establishing plausible deniability with regard to their own responsibility for what- ever actions were under way.5 The Ryan White Compre- hensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, passed into law in 1990, formalized the arrangement by setting up a pro- gram of grants to support direct services to community- based HIV organizations, provided those organizations would establish and be advised and overseen by a broad set of community organizations—units with which HIV efforts are presumably interdependent (hospitals, social service organizations, homeless shelters, public health units, and so forth)." (p 683)

2.) The third sector also functions to prevent the "grassroots" from growing too wide and broad-based, because that's essentially the most dangerous thing in the world for the dominant groups most invested in the status quo. Have you ever seen the film "How to Survive a Plague?" It tells about the history of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) and the fight for political acknowledgement of the HIV crisis and the demands for public support in dealing with it. On one hand, it's inspiring because it's about how the gay community self-organized creatively and militantly and had much success; but on another hand, something it reveals quite well is that when activists start picking up the slack from a state's inadequate provision of public services (in this case, essential health services), first of all this process will be biased from the start because the most well-off segments will have more resources and will therefore be over-represented within the movement from the start. Very striking about the film is that this "grassroots" fight against HIV was in large part driven by fairly well-off, often highly educated, mostly white, mostly cis-gendered males. For instance, at one point, they were literally doing their own medical research! This is pretty cool as far as it goes, but the obvious problem is that people with less resources who are often even more vulnerable, such as transgender people or poorer gay people are likely to remain relatively disempowered even within the "grassroots".

And while it's not bad in principle for only particular groups to initiate political organizing to save their lives, the real problem is with the state's institutionalization of these "grassroots" efforts. What happens, as we see today, is that these early inequalities in the "grassroots" are actually aggressively and strategically institutionalized by the state, and the power imbalances early on become rigidly and fatally divisive. Mananzala and Spade (2008) detail at length how the mainstream gay rights movement has reproduced exclusionary and oppressive hierarchies and have failed to represent the interests of the most vulnerable individuals and groups who have equal claim to the banner of LGBTQ. Mainstream LGBTQ organizations in the third sector (and nearly all mainstream organizations seeking to represent any marginalized group) tend to systematically reproduce the hierarchies and inequalites they originally wanted to fight.

But I and many others would argue that this is exactly the function and purpose of the third sector, it's like a political machine that takes "grassroots" demands for justice and offers to the most privileged members just enough to keep them happy, just enough to make them leave behind those who are worse off than themselves, just enough to keep them from actually disrupting the smooth operation of capital, state power, and the current distribution of wealth and resources.[^priceofsilence]

This is exactly what folks like Mananzala and Spade (2008) are testifying to and trying to contest. Projects such as the Sylvia Rivera Law Project are an effort to radicalize third-sector politics and subvert these well-known tendencies of status quo organizations. The degree to which this is possible in the long-run is an open question.

[^priceofsilence]: One could model this formally as a kind of price mechanism. I'm writing this very quickly so the following is probably not quite right, but basically, if the demand for justice goes up (massive contentiousness which threatens the state), while the supply of actual justice remains constant, the price which the state has to pay the grassroots to remain silent goes up. Alternatively, if the demand for justice is constant but there is a sudden decrease in the supply of it (the juntas, for instance), then the price the state has to pay protestors to remain silent increases this way as well. Thus, the Nobel Prize for Amnesty International right after the Nobel Prize for Milton Friedman and the experiments of the Southern Cone is exactly this: the supply of justice decreased, so they had to be willing to pay more for silence.
