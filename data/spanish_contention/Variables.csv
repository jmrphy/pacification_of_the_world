There is, in fact, substantial evidence that repressive regime responses to collective action can exacerbate domestic and ethnopolitical conflict (Lichbach, 1987; Tarrow, 1994; Francisco, 1995; Schock, 1996; Gurr and Moore, 1997; Moore, 2000; Beissinger, 2002) and incite mobilization among previously unmobilized populations (Gurr, 1993, 2000; Krain, 1998). Recent arguments have shown, however, that the effect of repression is not monotonic: according to the “substitution effect” (Lichbach, 1998; Moore, 2000), activists will substitute violent for nonviolent contention, and vice versa, depending on which is more actively pursued by public security forces. If this argument holds at the community level tested here, then increased levels of “protest policing” should be associated with decreases in nonviolent protest yet increases in both violent rebellious activities and electoral expressions of nationalism.

The logic is that, when an ethno-national community’s demands can be met via conventional means—such as occurs in federal systems—there is little reason to resort to nonconventional claims-making in the form of protest or rebellion (Lijphart, 1977). Nevertheless, there is some evidence for the counterclaim that nationalist representation in government increases nationalist conflict. Roeder (1991) and Snyder (1999) argue that, in a process similar to ethnic outbidding, the devolution of power can have the counter- intuitive effect of increasing demands for further autonomy by rendering it rational for politicians to make contentious appeals to nationality. This is especially dangerous with “incongruent federalism,” where the boundaries of the sub-federal political unit and an ethnic minority coincide (Lijphart, 1999). In such cases, the existence of an autonomous region effectively provides a ready-made template for secession.
<br><br>

In cross-national tests, it makes sense to operationalize conventional incorporation into the polity via autonomy statutes and the like. How- ever, since all of the regions in Spain have attained a relatively high degree of political autonomy since 1980, further sophistication was necessary for the present test. Instead of merely measuring the existence of autonomy, we have also measured nationalist political parties’ degree of involvement in the regional governments. All communities receive a score of 0 for their respective pre-autonomic periods, and a score from 1 to 5 in those cases where a nationalist party forms the regional government alone or in a coalition, using the following rules: (1) no nationalist representation in the regional government, (2) nationalists are minor partners in government (one seat in cabinet); (3) significant partner in government (several seats in cabinet); (4) major partner in government (greater than 20% of seats in cabinet); and (5) nationalist majority government.

Each region’s yearly expression score is thus dictated by its most militant political manifestation of nationalism. To create this measure, we first acquired data on the electoral, protest, and rebellious activities of nationalists in each of the seventeen communities throughout the country from 1977–1996. To assign the electoral scores, data were first gathered for all regional and national elections in the post-Franco era. Of particular interest was the percentage of the vote that was garnered in each Autonomous Community by regional nationalist political parties (such as the Basque Nationalist Party in the Basque Country or the Valencian Nationalist Bloc in Valencia). We then used Spain’s five-percent threshold for political party representation to determine whether a community could be considered to contain “electoral nationalism” in any given year. In effect, for each year that regional nationalist political parties garnered greater than 5% of the regional electoral vote (for years in between elections, scores were interpolated), that community received a score of at least “1” on the expression scale (or higher, if the community also engaged in a more intense form of contentious activity). For years in between elections, scores were interpolated.

<br><br>
The protest and rebellion scores are derived from an ethnonationalist contentious event data set developed from a non-sampled investigation of the annual indices to the Spanish daily <i>El País</i> from 1977–1996. These indices contain categorized summary reports of all articles appearing in the print version, and each summary report includes information on the time, place, actions, actors, and incidents surrounding each episode. Throughout Spain over the twenty-year time frame of the study, we recorded information on 4,267 nationalist contentious events. Using the same classificatory scheme for each event as the Minorities at Risk (MAR) project, nonviolent events were coded as “protest” and violent events as “rebellion.” Concurrently, each event was assigned a “region” label according to which of the seventeen Spanish regions formed the basis of support for the ethnopolitical action. That is, protest demonstrations undertaken by “Galician” ethno-political actors were counted as “Galician” protest events, wherever the action took place. In those years where an ethno-national community contained two or greater protest events, it was assigned a score of “2” on the expression scale; in those years where a community contained two or greater rebellion events, in turn, it was assigned a score of “3.”

Because all violent events will tend be reported in the national press, while only larger non-violent events will tend to be thus reported, this non-sampled data set contains more instances of rebellion than of protest. Consequently, this study should not be viewed as facilitating the study of small non-violent contentious events. Rather, it is a study of essentially all violent events and medium-to-large non-violent events. This is a further reason for why it is favorable to test protest and rebellion separately. ",Rebellion

While the measure is prima facie valid, the MAR team admits that the reliability of the measure of popular support is not fully satisfactory (Gurr, Marshall & Davenport, 2002). In response, I have enhanced the sophistication of the coding procedure by utilizing voting patterns as a gauge of popular support. Such a strategy has a high degree of utility in democratic countries, where contentious organizations can operate openly as political parties. This makes it relatively straightforward to determine both the number of and votes for nationalist organizations.

First, voting data were gathered for all regional and national elections in the post-Franco era. Regional elections were held in 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1995 in all autonomous communities except Galicia, Andalusia, Catalonia and the Basque Country, which individually set the timing for their own elections. This was the primary source of vote data for the open and militant mobilization variables. To increase the accuracy of the early scores, vote data from the national elections of 1977 and 1979 were also used. For years in between elections, the values were interpolated.

Openmob is measured here by multiplying the number of open organizations operative in each region by the total percentage of the vote (0-100) for nationalist political parties in regional elections. The end result is a measure of mobilization with greater reliability and sophistication than anything possible in a large-scale, cross-national project such as MAR. Scores range from 0 in Murcia (all years) to 470.47 for the Basque Country in 1990 (mean = 66.45, std. dev. = 111.52). The end result is a measure of mobilization with greater reliability and sophistication than anything possible in a large-scale, cross-national project such as MAR.

Though it is not possible to measure militant mobilization with the same degree of sophistication, a similarly reliable technique can be employed. In Spain, numerous legal political parties on the far left have advocated revolutionary means of change; often, these parties have been associated with actively militant, illegal political organizations. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, or Catalan Republican Left) and Bloc Esquerra d’Acció Nacionalista (BEAN, or Leftist Nationalist Action Bloc) in Valencia and Catalonia; Herri Batasuna (HB, or Popular Unity) and Euskadi Ezkerra (EE, or Basque Left) in Navarre and the Basque Country; and the Bloque Nacionalista Galego (BNG, or Galician Nationalist Bloc) in Galicia all advocated violent means to their political ends. During that time, two of these were associated with active terrorist organizations—HB with the ‘military’ wing of ETA (ETA-m, or Basque Homeland and Liberty—military), and EE with the slightly less radical ‘political-military’ wing of ETA (ETA-pm). Shortly thereafter, in 1983, ETA-pm put down its arms and EE, following suit, ceased to support violent means. Accordingly, a vote for EE before 1983, and a vote for HB up to 1996, can safely be considered a vote of support for the militant organizations for which EE and HB were the political arms. At the same time, a vote for the ERC in Catalonia from 1977 – 1990 could be considered tacit support for violence in Catalonia, even though no terrorist organization actually existed until Terra Lliure (Free Land) became active in 1980.

Following MAR coding procedures (Gurr, Marshall & Davenport, 2002), milmob was operationalized by measuring annually the number of active militant organizations in each region and the extent of popular support for each organization as evinced in the percentage of the vote given to its ‘political wing’ in regional elections. I used the same scale as MAR coders, where a value of ‘1’ was assigned to each organization with support of less than 10% of the community in regional elections and a ‘2’ for those organizations with support of between 10% and 20% of the population (there were no scores of ‘3’, since no individual organization had support of greater than 20% of the population). These organization values were then summed by region to create annual militant mobilization scores. As in MAR, values range from 0 to 3 (mean = 0.39, std. dev. = 0.78).

65,milmob,nationalism,Type object,Saxton (2005),,"Following MAR coding procedures, mobilization was operationalized by measuring annually the number of active militant organizations (milorg) in each region, up to a maximum of three, and the scope of popular support (milscop) for the largest of these organizations. As in MAR, the scope variable has a value of “1” if the movement is supported by less than 10% of the community, “2” if support is between 10% and 50%, and “3” if greater than 50%. In an enhancement of the original coding scheme, support was calculated via the percentage of the vote given to a militant organization’s “political wing” in regional elections.*  Mobilization is then the product of the organization and scope variables.

The rules for coding an event as ‘protest’ or ‘rebellion’ were analogous to those given to MAR coders.**  All intentionally violent contentious actions are coded as rebellion. All activities without this intention are coded as protest events. Riots and other spontaneous outbursts of violence are thus considered to be protest behavior.

<i>**Note:</i> Because of the lack of consistently available information for all 275 cases, the MAR project creates ordinal scales for rebellion and protest for each ethnopolitical group based on the single largest protest or rebellion event that takes place in each region every year. To create analogous scales out of the non-sampled event data available for Spain would result in an unnecessary loss of information. Because all violent events will tend be reported in the national press, while only larger non-violent events will tend to be thus reported, this non-sampled data set contains more instances of rebellion than of protest. Consequently, this study should not be viewed as facilitating the study of small non-violent contentious events. Rather, it is a study of essentially all violent events and medium-to-large non-violent events. This is a further reason for why it is favorable to test protest and rebellion separately. ",Protest
